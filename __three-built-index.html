        <h2>Work History</h2>
      
        <h3>21st Century Technology</h3>
        <h4>IT Technician</h4>
        <h5>Estero, FL</h5>
        <p>In this role I worked as one half of a two-man team in which I scheduled 
          appointments with clients to troubleshoot computer issues, everything from 
          help in using an unfamiliar program to Operating System installations, data 
          recovery, use lessons, to installing a home doorbell & camera system. 
          Appointments with clients were solo one-on-one jobs, interpreting a 
          layperson’s distress into actionable IT solutions. I was laid off from 
          this position due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic whhen work dried up.</p>

        <h3>Gartner, Inc</h3>
        <h4>Master Data Management Intern</h4>
        <h5>Stamford, CT</h5>
        <p>During the summer of 2019 (May to August) I worked at the Gartner 
          Headquarters in Stamford, CT 30 minutes from New York City. Here I 
          worked as part of a team where we managed database connections and 
          curated the data that we would query from multiple sources, creating 
          health checks on our data. Here I developed an automated process 
          for querying databases and summarizing that data output as a mass 
          email to the other members of our department providing them a snapshot 
          of how the accounts we manage were performing and which accounts (out 
          of more than 750,000 managed accounts) may have needed further attention 
          (e.g. if account details were only partially filled in or had duplicate 
          entries). We used this data as a basis for creating a browser-accessible 
          report (dashboard) in Microsoft Power BI.</p>
          
        <h3>Florida Gulf Coast University</h3>
        <h4>Camp Counselor</h4>
        <h5>Estero, FL</h5>
        <p>I worked as both a tutor & Learning Assistant for other students during 
          the semester and a camp counselor during the summer at FGCU. As an LA I 
          assisted students with comprehending course material in real-time, grading 
          assignments for classes with 30-50 students. Courses included: Introduction 
          to Computer Science & Introduction to Programming. During the summer of 
          2017 I worked as a camp counselor for the Coding Academy, STEM Academy, and 
          Mathletes camps.</p>
